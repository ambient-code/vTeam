**Authors:** @gkrumbac  
**Status:** Draft  
**Creation Date:** 2024-01-XX  
**Last Updated:** 2024-01-XX

## Summary
Transform Claude Runner into a secure multi-tenant platform with namespace isolation, OAuth2 authentication, and resource quotas.

## Motivation
### Goals
- Support multiple users/organizations with complete isolation
- Implement industry-standard authentication (OAuth2/OIDC)  
- Enable self-service user onboarding
- Provide usage-based resource quotas
- Support both external APIs and self-hosted models

### Non-Goals
- Billing/payment integration (future phase)
- Multi-cloud deployment (single cluster focus)
- Legacy session format support

### User Stories
- As a **platform administrator**, I want to onboard new organizations safely
- As a **research user**, I want to manage my own API keys and quotas
- As a **security team member**, I want to audit all cross-tenant access
- As a **organization admin**, I want to control my team's model access

## Proposal
### Current State vs Target State

| Aspect | Current State | Target State |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Tenancy** | Single namespace, shared resources | Namespace-per-tenant with isolation |
| **Authentication** | None | OAuth2/OIDC with major providers |
| **Authorization** | Basic K8s RBAC | Fine-grained multi-tenant RBAC |
| **API Keys** | Shared Anthropic key | Per-user secrets management |
| **Resources** | Unlimited usage | Quota-based resource management |
| **Monitoring** | System-level only | Per-tenant metrics and isolation |
| **Models** | Anthropic Claude only | Multiple providers + self-hosted |
| **Security** | Basic K8s security | OWASP-compliant microservices security |

### Architecture Overview

#### Multi-Tenant Namespace Strategy
**Application Namespace (`claude-runner-system`):**
- Shared infrastructure components (OAuth proxy, operators, monitoring)
- System-wide services and controllers
- Model servers for self-hosted models

**Per-Tenant Namespaces (`claude-runner-user-{user-id}`):**
- Isolated user workloads and data
- User-specific secrets (API keys, tokens)
- Custom resources owned by the user
- Network policies for isolation

#### Authentication & Identity Flow
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "External"
        USER[User Browser]
        IDP[OAuth Provider<br/>Google/GitHub/Microsoft]
    end
    
    subgraph "claude-runner-system namespace"
        PROXY[OAuth2 Proxy]
        API[Backend API]
        OP[Research Operator]
    end
    
    subgraph "claude-runner-user-{id} namespace"
        CR[ResearchSession CR]
        JOB[Kubernetes Job]
        SECRET[User Secrets<br/>API Keys]
    end
    
    subgraph "External Services"
        CLAUDE[Anthropic API]
        MODELS[Self-hosted Models]
    end
    
    USER --> PROXY
    PROXY --> IDP
    PROXY --> API
    API --> CR
    OP --> JOB
    JOB --> SECRET
    JOB --> CLAUDE
    JOB --> MODELS
```

#### Security Model (OWASP-Compliant)
Following OWASP Microservices Security patterns:

**Edge-level Authorization:**
- OAuth2 proxy handles external authentication
- Token validation and user identity extraction
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

**Service-level Authorization:**
- User passport system with HMAC signatures
- Per-namespace RBAC enforcement
- Fine-grained permissions for resources

**Identity Propagation:**
```go
type UserPassport struct {
    UserID      string   `json:"user_id"`
    Email       string   `json:"email"`
    Groups      []string `json:"groups"`
    Permissions []string `json:"permissions"`
    Tier        string   `json:"tier"`
    Namespace   string   `json:"namespace"`
    Signature   string   `json:"signature"` // HMAC for integrity
}
```

**Network Isolation:**
- Kubernetes NetworkPolicies for tenant separation
- Application namespace ingress/egress rules
- Restricted external API access
