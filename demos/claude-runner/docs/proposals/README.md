# Claude Runner Enhancement Proposals (CREPs)

## Overview
For significant features or architectural changes to Claude Runner, we use a formal proposal process similar to Kubeflow's KEPs.

## When to Write a CREP
- Major architectural changes (like multi-tenancy)
- New APIs or significant API changes
- Features affecting security or isolation
- Changes impacting backward compatibility
- Features requiring significant resource investment

## CREP Process
1. **Draft**: Create initial proposal
2. **Community Review**: Share with stakeholders
3. **Refinement**: Address feedback
4. **Approval**: Get maintainer sign-off
5. **Implementation**: Execute the plan

## CREP Format
See `template.md` for the standard format.
