## 🏗️ Architecture

### Agent Roles

The RFE Builder implements a 7-agent workflow system:

- **📊 Parker (Product Manager)** - RFE prioritization and stakeholder communication

2. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Title**: Brief descriptive title
   - **Description**: Detailed enhancement description
   - **Business Justification** (optional): Business value explanation
   - **Technical Requirements** (optional): Technical constraints
   - **Success Criteria** (optional): Implementation success metrics
3. Click **"Create RFE"** to submit

### Managing Workflow

1. **View Progress**: Use **"📊 Workflow Overview"** to see visual workflow status
2. **Agent Actions**: Access **"👥 Agent Dashboard"** to perform role-specific tasks
3. **Track RFEs**: Monitor all submissions in **"📈 RFE List"** with filtering options

### Agent-Specific Actions

Each agent role has specific capabilities with AI-powered assistance:

- **Parker (PM)**:
  - Prioritize new RFEs with AI business impact analysis
