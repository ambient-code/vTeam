  Please conduct a technical review of this RFE:

  **RFE Details:**
  Title: {title}
  Description: {description}
  Technical Requirements: {technical_requirements}
  Business Priority: {priority}

  **Current System Context:**
  {system_context}

  **Technical Review Required:**
  1. **Feasibility Assessment**: Is this technically achievable with current architecture?
  2. **Architectural Impact**: How does this affect existing systems and components?
  3. **Integration Concerns**: What systems/services need to be modified or integrated?
  4. **Scalability & Performance**: What are the performance implications?
  5. **Security Considerations**: Are there any security risks or requirements?
