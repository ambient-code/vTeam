# Fork PR Support: This workflow now supports pull requests from forked repositories
# See: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/issues/339
# 
# Three fixes applied:
# 1. Checkout fork repository (head.repo.full_name)
# 2. Add github_token to bypass OIDC authentication issues
# 3. Add allowed_non_write_users to permit fork contributors
