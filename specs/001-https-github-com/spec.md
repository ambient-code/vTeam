# Feature Specification: Workflow Status and Notifications Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-https-github-com`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "<https://github.com/ambient-code/vTeam/issues/122>"

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a software development team member, I need a centralized dashboard that shows me the current status of all workflow activities so I can understand what work is available for me to pick up, what's currently in progress, and where bottlenecks might be occurring in our development process.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am logged into the workflow dashboard, **When** I view the left-column workflow status, **Then** I can see the current status of all active workflows with time and cost metrics
2. **Given** there is pending work assigned to me, **When** I check the notification system, **Then** I see an envelope icon indicating unread messages and can view the details of work waiting for my attention
3. **Given** I complete a workflow step, **When** the system updates, **Then** the next team member receives a notification that work is ready for handoff
4. **Given** I am viewing a workflow step, **When** I examine the metadata, **Then** I can see attribution information including time spent, cost incurred, and tools used (e.g., which LLM processed this step)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a workflow step fails or times out?
- How does the system handle conflicting work assignments or multiple people trying to claim the same task?
- What occurs when notification delivery fails or team members are unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a left-column workflow dashboard showing current status of all active workflows
- **FR-002**: System MUST show what workflow steps are next and what steps are waiting for action
- **FR-003**: System MUST display per-step metrics including time spent and cost incurred
- **FR-004**: System MUST show step attribution indicating which team member or system processed each step
- **FR-005**: System MUST display metadata for each step including tools used (e.g., LLM model information)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a notification system similar to GitHub inbox or Jira kanban board
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a small envelope icon when there are unread messages or pending work items
- **FR-008**: Team members MUST be able to view details of work waiting for their attention
- **FR-009**: System MUST enable seamless work handoffs between team members
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide real-time updates when workflow status changes
- **FR-011**: System MUST authenticate users to ensure secure access to workflow information [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method not specified - SSO, email/password, existing system integration?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST track workflow interactions between humans and computers [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific interaction types and data points to track not detailed]
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle work assignment conflicts [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: conflict resolution mechanism not specified]
- **FR-014**: System MUST define data retention policies [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how long workflow data, metrics, and notifications should be retained]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Workflow**: Represents a sequence of steps in the software development process, contains status, current step, and overall progress information
- **WorkflowStep**: Individual step within a workflow, includes time metrics, cost data, attribution, metadata, and completion status
- **Notification**: Message or alert for team members, contains work item details, priority level, and read status
- **TeamMember**: User who can interact with workflows, includes role information, notification preferences, and current work assignments
- **WorkItem**: Unit of work that can be assigned and transferred between team members, contains description, status, and assignment history
- **Metrics**: Performance data for workflow steps, includes time spent, cost calculations, and tool usage information
